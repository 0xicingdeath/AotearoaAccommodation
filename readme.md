#AotearoaAccommodation 

When I was in high school, I really wanted to go to New Zealand. I had the trip planned out to the detail - it was run by the school, so I calculated most things including where we were staying for accommodation, where we were going for food, and everything in detail. Soon enough, the list of places we were staying was getting too long (imagine, it was **almost** a different place per night. This program really helped me in keeping track of where we were going. 

##Things I learned 
 1. This was my first understanding of array of objects, which really helped me understand the concept. I should have made the methods in Location private, and then made getter and setters to hide it from the client code, but I was unfamiliar with the difference between private and public at the time. 


##Things I Would Change 
 + Currently, it is only made with System.out.println()'s, and I would DEFINITELY change it into a GUI interface right now.
